# Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
## Implementation of a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) in Java.

A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data.

### The project consists of 4 tasks:

**TASK 1**: Generate randomly chosen binary M messages of K bits (e.g. K = 10).

**TASK 2**: CRC calculation for the previous M message. User must give the P binary number.

**TASK 3**: Sending the CRC message with a Bit-Error-Rate E (e.g. E=10^(-3)).

**TASK 4**: Checking for errors at receiver 

***(NOTE: Correction of false messages is not included in this project)***
